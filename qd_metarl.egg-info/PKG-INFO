# QD-MetaRL

## Setup

These setup instructions were written for Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 12. 
Ensure that you also have CUDA toolkit installed, as well as the latest version of Anaconda. 
Additionally, we use virtual displays for certain environments, for which you will need to install Xvfb via:

```bash
sudo apt install xvfb
```

Clone repository:

```bash
git clone <anonrepo>
```

Upgrade pip if necessary (developed with version `22.3.1`):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
``` 

Install SWIG (required for `Box2D`), if not already installed (below is `Ubuntu`-specific command): 

```bash
sudo apt install swig

```

Run the following setup script to create a `conda` environment and to install the relevant dependencies:

```bash
. ./setup.sh
```

> __Note__: `mpi4py` is installed via `conda` before the rest of the requirements because
pip was having trouble installing the package at the time of writing.
`Tensorflow` is installed just before `mpi4py` because it is a required dependency.
`Pytorch` installation via `pip` was raising all sorts of dependency errors, so
we are using `conda` for now. The rest of the dependencies are then installed
via `pip` using the last line.

> __Note__: If you get the following error:
> ```bash
> AttributeError: module '_Box2D' has no attribute 'RAND_LIMIT_swigconstant'
> ```
> Then try: 
> ```bash
> pip uninstall box2d-py
> pip install box2d-py
> ```
